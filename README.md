Incorporates 7Zip, Tar, GZIP md5sums, sha1sums, sha256sums

This project will create a Windows Zip file, a Linux tar.gz and bzip2 compressed files using the name of the folder that
you submit after launching DCT.

It will place your project compressed files in the project directory and the md5 sha1 and sha256 hashes in
the hash folder.

This tool is great for people who author programs, tools, platforms and wish to distribute them from a website.

Download using Git
